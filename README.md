**NArchitecture** is a **.NET Core framework** project designed to provide a well-structured and scalable architecture for modern applications. Inspired by **Clean Architecture**, it aims to enhance development efficiency by offering a robust framework that enforces clean coding principles and best practices.

By providing a solid foundation, **NArchitecture** helps developers build **modular, maintainable, and testable applications** while ensuring a clear separation of concerns. It includes a wide range of built-in features such as **CQRS, Advanced Repository, Dynamic Querying, JWT, OTP, Role-Based Management, Distributed Caching, Logging, Search Engine**, and more.

To further accelerate development, the framework supports **code generation** through the [Code Generator](https://github.com/kodlamaio-projects/nArchitecture.Gen), enabling rapid project setup and consistent implementation of architectural patterns. Additionally, its [Core Packages](https://github.com/kodlamaio-projects/nArchitecture.Core) provide essential components to streamline development and maintain a high-quality codebase.

With **NArchitecture**, developers can focus on writing business logic rather than spending time on repetitive infrastructure setup, ultimately delivering cleaner, more efficient, and scalable software solutions.
