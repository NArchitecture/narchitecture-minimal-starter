# 📝 Coding Style
This document outlines the coding style and conventions used in the NArchitecture project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency and readability across the codebase.

## 📚 General Guidelines
- Follow the SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability.
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Avoid code duplication and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use meaningful variable, function, and class names that reflect their purpose.
- Follow the naming conventions of the respective programming language (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript/Java, snake_case for Python, PascalCase for C# classes).

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
- Avoid hardcoding secrets.
- Validate user inputs.
- Prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS etc.

## ⚙️ Performance and Efficiency
- Use asynchronous programming where applicable to improve performance.
- Avoid blocking the main thread unnecessarily.
- Write optimized and efficient code by following best practices for performance, memory management, and algorithmic efficiency.
- Avoid unnecessary computations, optimize loops, and use appropriate data structures.

## 📦 Dependencies
- Minimize unnecessary dependencies.
- Use built-in libraries where possible to reduce package bloat.

## 🧪 Testability
- Write testable code by following dependency injection and modular design principles.
- Ensure functions and classes are easily testable.

## 🐛 Logging and Debugging
- Implement meaningful logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Use structured logging instead of print statements.

## 🌐 Compatibility
- Ensure code is compatible with the target environment (e.g., browser compatibility for web apps, cross-platform support for apps).

## 🛠️ Language-Specific Guidelines

- Use XML documentation for classes, interfaces, important methods, and properties.
- Avoid redundant or unnecessary comments.
- Use concise inline comments only where necessary for clarity.
- Utilize modern C# features such as pattern matching, async/await, and LINQ.
- Make use of generics, reflection, and design patterns to enhance maintainability.
